### Module summary

This module downloads and pre-process species (ref:percent) cover data layers to
be passed to other LandR data modules (e.g., *Biomass_borealDataPrep*) or to the
LandR forest simulation module *Biomass_core*.

### Links to other modules {#bsppdata-links-modules}

Intended to be used with any LandR modules that require species percent cover
raster layers. See
[here](https://rpubs.com/PredictiveEcology/LandR_Module_Ecosystem) for all
available modules in the LandR ecosystem and select *Biomass_borealDataPrep*
from the drop-down menu to see potential linkages.

-   [*Biomass_borealDataPrep*](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/Biomass_borealDataPrep):
    prepares all parameters and inputs (including initial landscape conditions)
    that *Biomass_core* needs to run a realistic simulation. By default, the
    values/inputs produced are relevant for boreal forests of Western Canada;

-   [*Biomass_core*](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/Biomass_core): core
    forest dynamics simulation module.

## Module manual

### General functioning {#bsppdata-general-functioning}

This module accesses and processes species percent cover ((ref:percent) cover)
data for the parametrisation and initialisation of LandR *Biomass_core*. This
module ensures 1) all data use the same geospatial geometries and 2) that these
are correctly re-projected to studyAreaLarge, and 3) attempts to sequentially
fill-in and replace the lowest quality data with higher quality data when
several data sources are used. It's primary output is a `RasterStack` of species
(ref:percent) cover, with each layer corresponding to a species.

Currently, the module can access the Canadian Forest Inventory forest attributes
kNN dataset [the default; @BeaudoinEtAl2017], the Common Attribute Schema for
Forest Resource Inventories [CASFRI; @Cosco2011] dataset, the Ontario Forest
Resource Inventory (ONFRI), a dataset specific to Alberta compiled by Paul
Pickell, and other Alberta forest inventory datasets. However, **only the NFI
kNN data are freely available** -- access to the other datasets must be granted
by module developers and data owners, and a Google account is required.
Nevertheless, the module is flexible enough that any user can use it to process
additional datasets, provided that an adequate R function is passed to the
module (see `types` parameter details in [Parameters])

When multiple data sources are used, the module will use replace lower quality
data with higher quality data following the order specified by the parameter
`types` (see [Parameters]).

When multiple species of a given data source are to be grouped, (ref:percent)
cover is summed across species of the same group within each pixel. Please see
the `sppEquiv` input in [Input objects] for information on how species groups
are defined.

The module can also exclude species (ref:percent) cover layers if they don't
have a minimum (ref:percent) cover value in at least one pixel. This means that
the user should still inspect in how many pixels the species is deemed present,
as it is possible that some data have only a few pixels with high (ref:percent)
cover for a given species. In this case, the user may choose to exclude these
species *a posteriori*. The summary plot automatically shown by
*Biomass_speciesData* can help diagnose whether certain species are present in
very few pixels (see Fig. \@ref(fig:fig-Biomass-speciesDataOutPlots)).

#### List of input objects {#bsppdata-inputs-list}

Below is the full list of input objects that *Biomass_speciesData* requires
(Table \@ref(tab:moduleInputs2-Biomass-speciesData)). Of these, the only input
that **must** be provided (i.e., *Biomass_speciesData* does not have a default
for) is `studyAreaLarge`.

Of the inputs in Table \@ref(tab:moduleInputs2-Biomass-speciesData), the
following are particularly important and deserve special attention:

-   `studyAreaLarge` -- the polygon defining the area for which species cover
    data area desired. It can be larger (but never smaller) that the study area
    used in the simulation of forest dynamics (i.e., `studyArea` object in
    *Biomass_core*).

-   `sppEquiv` -- a table of correspondences between different species naming
    conventions. This table is used across several LandR modules, including
    *Biomass_core*. It is particularly important here because it will determine
    whether and how species (and their cover layers) are merged, if this is
    desired by the user. For instance, if the user wishes to simulate a generic
    *Picea spp.* that includes, *Picea glauca*, *Picea mariana* and *Picea
    engelmannii*, they will need to provide these three species names in the
    data column (e.g., `KNN` if obtaining forest attribute kNN data layers from
    the Canadian Forest Inventory), but the same name (e.g., "Pice_Spp") in the
    coumn chosen for the naming convention used throughout the simulation (the
    `sppEquivCol` parameter); see Table
    \@ref(tab:mergingSpp-Biomass-speciesData) for an example).

```{r mergingSpp-Biomass-speciesData, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
sppEquiv2 <- sppEquiv[grepl("Abie|Pice|Pinu_Con", Boreal), .(Latin_full, KNN, Boreal)][KNN != "Pice_Spp"]
sppEquiv2[grepl("Pice_", KNN), Boreal := "Pice_Spp"]
sppEquiv2[, "Modelled as" := Latin_full]
sppEquiv2[Boreal == "Pice_Spp", `Modelled as` := "Picea spp."]
setnames(sppEquiv2, "Latin_full", "Species")

sppEquiv2[, `:=`(Species = sub("(.*)", "\\*\\1\\*", Species),
                 `Modelled as` = sub("(.*)", "\\*\\1\\*", `Modelled as`))]  ## for italics

knitr::kable(sppEquiv2, 
             caption = "Example of species merging for simulation. Here the user wants to model (ref:Abie-bal), (ref:Abie-las) and (ref:Pinu-con) as separate species, but all (ref:Pice-sp) as a genus-level group. For this, all six species are identified in the \\'KNN\\' column, so that their (ref:percent) cover layers can be obtained, but in the \\'Boreal\\' column (which defines the naming convention used in the simulation in this example) all (ref:Pice-sp) have the same name. (ref:Biomass-speciesData) will merge their (ref:percent) cover data into a single layer by summing their cover per pixel.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("scale_down", "repeat_header"), full_width = TRUE)
```

```{r moduleInputs2-Biomass-speciesData, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
df_inputs <- SpaDES.core::moduleInputs("Biomass_speciesData", "..")
knitr::kable(df_inputs, 
             caption = "List of (ref:Biomass-speciesData) input objects and their description.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("scale_down", "repeat_header"), full_width = TRUE)
```

#### List of parameters {#bsppdata-params-list}

Table \@ref(tab:moduleParams2-Biomass-speciesData) lists all parameters used in
*Biomass_speciesData* and their detailed information. Of these parameters, the
following are particularly important:

-   `coverThresh` -- integer. Defines a minimum (ref:percent) cover value (from
    0-100) that the species must have in at least one pixel to be considered
    present in the study area, otherwise it is excluded from the final stack of
    species layers. Note that this will affect what species have data for an
    eventual simulation and the user will need to adjust simulation parameters
    (e.g., species in trait tables will need to match the species in the cover
    layers) accordingly.

-   `types` -- character. Which (ref:percent) cover data sources are to be used
    (see [Detailed description]). Several data sources can be passed, in which
    case the module will overlay the lower quality layers with higher quality
    ones **following the order of data sources specified by `types`** -- i.e.,
    if `types == c("KNN", "CASFRI", "ForestInventory")`, *KNN* is assumed to be
    the lowest quality data set and *ForestInventory* the highest: values in
    *KNN* layers are replaced with overlapping values from *CASFRI* layers and
    values from *KNN* and *CASFRI* layers are replaced with overlapping values
    of *ForestInventory* layers.

```{r moduleParams2-Biomass-speciesData, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
df_params <- SpaDES.core::moduleParams("Biomass_speciesData", "..")
knitr::kable(df_params,
             caption = "List of (ref:Biomass-speciesData) parameters and their description.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("scale_down", "repeat_header"), full_width = TRUE)
```

#### List of outputs {#bsppdata-outputs-list}

The module produces the outputs in Table
\@ref(tab:moduleOutputs-Biomass-speciesData), and automatically saves the
processed species cover layers in the output path defined in
`getPaths(sim)$outputPath`.

```{r moduleOutputs-Biomass-speciesData, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
df_outputs <- SpaDES.core::moduleOutputs("Biomass_speciesData", "..")[, c(1, 3)] ## name + desc only
knitr::kable(df_outputs,
             caption = "List of (ref:Biomass-speciesData) output objects and their description.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("scale_down", "repeat_header"), full_width = TRUE) %>%
  kableExtra::column_spec(column = 2, width = "40em")
```

### Simulation flow and module events {#bsppdata-sim-flow}

*Biomass_speciesData* initialises itself and prepares all inputs provided that
it has internet access to download the raw data layers, or that these layers
have been previously downloaded and stored in the folder specified by
`options("reproducible.destinationPath")`[^1].

[^1]: Raw data layers downloaded by the module are saved in \`dataPath(sim)\`,
    which can be controlled via \`options(reproducible.destinationPath = ...)\`.

The module defaults to processing cover data fo all species listed in the
`Boreal` column of the default `sppEquiv` input `data.table` object, for which
there are available (ref:percent) cover layers in the kNN dataset (Table
\@ref(tab:defaultSppBiomass-speciesData); see `?LandR::sppEquivalencies_CA` for
more information):

```{r defaultSppBiomass-speciesData, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
data("sppEquivalencies_CA", package = "LandR", envir = environment())
sppEquiv <- as.data.table(sppEquivalencies_CA)

## filter only common species between kNN and default "Boreal" column
## remove empty species names
sppEquiv <- sppEquiv[!(is.na(Boreal) | is.na(KNN) | Boreal == "" | KNN == ""),]
sppEquiv2 <- sppEquiv[, .("Species" = Latin_full, "Generic name" = EN_generic_full)]
sppEquiv2[, Species := sub("(.*)", "\\*\\1\\*", Species)]  ## for italics

knitr::kable(sppEquiv2, 
             caption = "List of species cover data downloaded by default by  (ref:Biomass-speciesData).") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("scale_down", "repeat_header"), full_width = TRUE)
```

*Biomass_speciesData* only runs two events, the `init` event where all species
cover layers are processed and a plotting event (`initPlot`) that plots the
final layers.

The general flow of *Biomass_speciesData* processes is:

1.  Download (if necessary) of and spatial processing of species cover layers
    from the first data source listed in the `types` parameter. Spatial
    processing consists in sub-setting the data to the area defined by
    `studyAreaLarge` and ensuring that the spatial projection and resolution
    match those of `rasterToMatchLarge`. After spatial processing, species
    layers that have no pixels with values \>= to the `coverThresh` parameter
    are excluded.

2.  If more than one data source is listed in `types`, the second set of species
    cover layers is downloaded and processed as above.

3.  The second set of layers is assumed to be the highest quality dataset and
    used to replaced overlapping pixel values on the first (including for
    species whose layers may have been initially excluded after applying the
    `coverThresh` filter).

4.  Steps 2 and 3 are repeated for remaining data sources listed in `types`.

5.  Final layers are saved to disk and plotted (`initPlot` event). A summary of
    number of pixels with forest cover are calculated (`treed`and `numTreed`
    output objects; see [Module outputs]).

## Usage example {#bsppdata-example}

This module can be run stand-alone, but it only compiles species percent cover
datr into layers used by other modules.

### Load `SpaDES` and other packages.

```{r load-SpaDES-Biomass-speciesData}
if (!require(Require)) {
  install.packages("Require")
  library(Require)
}

Require(c("PredictiveEcology/SpaDES.install",
          "SpaDES", "PredictiveEcology/SpaDES.core@development",
          "PredictiveEcology/LandR"), 
        install_githubArgs = list(dependencies = TRUE))
```

### Get module, necessary packages and set up folder directories

```{r module usage example setup -Biomass-speciesData, eval = FALSE}
tempDir <- tempdir()
paths <- list(inputPath = normPath(file.path(tempDir, "inputs")), 
              cachePath = normPath(file.path(tempDir, "cache")), 
              modulePath = normPath(file.path(tempDir, "modules")), 
              outputPath = normPath(file.path(tempDir, "outputs")))

getModule("PredictiveEcology/Biomass_speciesData", 
          modulePath = paths$modulePath, overwrite = TRUE)

## make sure all necessary packages are installed:
makeSureAllPackagesInstalled(paths$modulePath)
```

### Setup simulation

For this demonstration we are using all default parameter values, except
`coverThresh` , which is lowered to 5(ref:percent). The species layers (the
major output of interest) are saved automatically, so there is no need to tell
`spades` what to save using the `outputs` argument (see
`?SpaDES.core::outputs`).

We pass the global parameter `.plotInitialTime = 1` in the `simInitAndSpades`
function to activate plotting.

```{r  module usage example setup2-Biomass-speciesData, eval = FALSE}
# User may want to set some options -- see ?reproducibleOptions 
#    -- e.g., often the path to the 'inputs' folder will be set outside of project by user:
# options(reproducible.inputPaths = "E:/Data/LandR_related/") # to re-use datasets across projects
studyAreaLarge <- Cache(randomStudyArea, size = 1e7,
                        cacheRepo = paths$cachePath) # cache this so it creates a random one only once on a machine

# Pick the species you want to work with -- here we use the naming convention in "Boreal" column of LandR::sppEquivalencies_CA (default)
speciesNameConvention <- "Boreal"
speciesToUse <- c("Pice_Gla", "Popu_Tre", "Pinu_Con")

sppEquiv <- LandR::sppEquivalencies_CA[get(speciesNameConvention) %in% speciesToUse]
# Assign a colour convention for graphics for each species
sppColorVect <- LandR::sppColors(sppEquiv, speciesNameConvention,
                                 newVals = "Mixed", palette = "Set1")

## Usage example
modules <- list("Biomass_speciesData")
objects <- list("studyAreaLarge" = studyAreaLarge,
                "sppEquiv" = sppEquiv,
                "sppColorVect" = sppColorVect)
params <- list("Biomass_speciesData" = list("coverThresh" = 5L))
```

### Run module

Note that because this is a data module (i.e., only attempts to prepare data for
the simulation) we are not iterating it and so both the start and end times are
set to `1` here.

```{r module usage example2-Biomass-speciesData}
opts <- options(reproducible.useCache = TRUE,
                reproducible.inputPaths = paths$inputPath)

mySimOut <- simInitAndSpades(times = list(start = 1, end = 1),
                             modules = modules, 
                             parameters = params,
                             objects = objects, 
                             paths = paths,
                             .plotInitialTime = 1)
options(opts)
```

Here are some of outputs of *Biomass_speciesData* (dominant species) in a
randomly generated study area within Canada.

```{r fig-Biomass-speciesDataOutPlots, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "70%", fig.cap = "(ref:Biomass-speciesData) automatically generates a plot of species dominance and number of presences in the study area when `.plotInitialTime=1` is passed as an argument."}
